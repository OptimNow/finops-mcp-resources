# What is MCP and Why It’s Useful for FinOps

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an emerging open standard that connects Large Language Models (LLMs) to external tools and data sources. Think of it as a **USB key for LLMs**: instead of operating in isolation, the model can securely “plug in” to systems like AWS Pricing APIs, budget reports, or cost optimization scripts.

For **FinOps practitioners**, MCP opens up exciting possibilities:

- 🔍 **Real-time cost analysis**: query cloud pricing and usage data directly through your LLM, without static exports.  
- 📊 **Automated reporting**: generate budget variance reports, savings summaries, or optimization insights with a single prompt.  
- ☁️ **Multi-cloud management**: connect the same workflow across AWS, Azure, and GCP MCP servers.  
- 🛡️ **Governance potential**: manage access and visibility centrally, with scope-limited credentials.



**Where it shines today:**  
MCP is especially powerful for **simulation and scenario analysis** — testing what-if cases, comparing regional costs, or generating forecasts on demand.



**Where to be cautious:**  
LLMs can still **hallucinate** or misinterpret cost data. And while MCP can connect to APIs that could take actions (e.g., shutting down resources), it’s not yet advisable to let it act autonomously without human validation.

💡 **Bottom line:** MCP turns LLMs from “chatbots” into **FinOps copilots** — fast, flexible, but still in need of governance guardrails.
