# MCP Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architectural Components  

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** defines a modular, layered architecture that separates AI orchestration, data access, and interaction logic.  
This design enables flexibility, reusability, and observability ‚Äî essential principles for scalable and governable AI systems.  

### 1. MCP Client  
The **Client** is the AI-enabled application or agent that consumes context and invokes actions.  
**Responsibilities include:**  
- Discovering available tools and resources exposed by the protocol.  
- Dynamically invoking tools based on model intent.  
- Composing and reusing structured prompts.  
- Routing queries and contextual data through the MCP interface.

### 2. MCP Host  
The **Host** acts as the orchestrator and runtime environment for one or more MCP Servers.  
It provides the operational, networking, and governance layers needed for enterprise-scale deployments.  
**Responsibilities include:**  
- Authentication and authorization between clients and services.  
- Load balancing and scaling across multiple MCP Servers.  
- Observability, logging, and usage metering (critical for FinOps).  
- Centralized governance and routing for AI traffic.

### 3. MCP Server  
Each **Server** implements the protocol and exposes three fundamental resource types:  

- **Tools** ‚Üí Declarative, model-invoked actions (e.g., query a database, call an API, write files).  
- **Resources** ‚Üí Application-controlled data elements, either static (documents, metadata) or dynamic (logs, JSON records), used to ground model responses.  
- **Prompts** ‚Üí Reusable, version-controlled interaction templates that standardize AI behavior, support cost attribution, and ensure consistency across use cases.

### 4. Interoperability & Orchestration  
The true strength of MCP lies in how these components interoperate:  
1. The **Client** requests a prompt using a known template.  
2. The **Host** routes the request to the appropriate **Server**.  
3. The **Server** interpolates relevant **Resources**, invokes **Tools**, and assembles the final prompt.  
4. The result flows back through the **Host**, enabling auditing, logging, and metric collection.

## üîÑ MCP Interaction Cycle  

Beyond the core components, MCP defines a standardized **interaction cycle** for communication between Clients, Hosts, and Servers:  

1. **Client Communication** ‚Äì the Client maintains a dedicated connection to the Server.  
2. **Server Bridging** ‚Äì the Server acts as a bridge to external systems.  
3. **Tool Invocation** ‚Äì the model calls tools for structured actions.  
4. **Resource Provisioning** ‚Äì contextual data is supplied to ground the LLM‚Äôs tasks.  
5. **Prompt Execution** ‚Äì complex operations are triggered via prompts.  
6. **Sampling Control** ‚Äì the Server can adjust or influence inference.  
7. **Notification Push** ‚Äì asynchronous updates flow back to the Client.

## üåê Key Architectural Considerations  

- **Security & Governance**  
  - MCP does not standardize authentication; implementations often rely on OAuth, API keys, or enterprise SSO.  
  - Fine-grained RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) should be layered on top to avoid overexposure of tools and resources.  

- **FinOps & Observability**  
  - MCP‚Äôs modularity enables cost attribution at the level of prompts, tools, and resources.  
  - This aligns with FinOps practices by connecting usage patterns with cost accountability.  

- **Extensibility**  
  - MCP enables dynamic discovery of tools and capabilities.  
  - Clients can query a Server to retrieve available resources and adjust UI/UX accordingly ‚Äî making MCP act as a ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for capabilities.
