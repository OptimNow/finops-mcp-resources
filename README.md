## 🧩 What is MCP?
MCP is a protocol that lets **LLMs act as agents** by safely connecting to external tools (servers) like AWS Pricing, Cloudability, or tagging checkers.  
In FinOps, MCP unlocks:
- Faster cost simulations
- Real-time tagging compliance
- Automated anomaly checks
- Cost optimization recommendations  

But also raises **governance and security** challenges — this repo addresses both sides.
