## Simulation & Forecasting Use Case with AWS MCP Agents

This demo shows how **AWS MCP agents** transform FinOps workflowsâ€”from **prompt to cost estimates**â€”in just minutes. Instead of waiting weeks for manual analysis and prototyping, MCP agents connect prompts to AWS data, Infrastructure-as-Code, and cost models to deliver actionable results.

### What the demo covers

- **Business Scenario**: evaluate the costs and ROI of an environment IoT monitoring platform/
- **Use case setup**: First evaluate a prototype with 50 sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality) transmitting data every 5 mintues, with real-time dashboarding, data ingestion ingest in **US-East-1** with analytics in **Paris**. Generate a cloudformation template of the platform with the MCP agents and run it in AWS as a prototype. 
- **MCP output**: 
  - Estimated costs of the prototype (table by service & region)
  - CloudFormation template for deployment
  - Python load generator script
- **Reality check**: Compare **estimates vs actuals** after 48h of real usage (initial gap due to S3 underestimation).
- **Refinement**: Adjust estimates, rerun the agent, get results within **<5% accuracy**.
- **Scaling simulation**: Model 100Ã— more sensors, calculate unit economics and cost breakdown (ingest 52%, storage 28%, transfer 20%).
- **Business case**: Pricing strategy at **60% gross margin**, showing how MCP supports both technical and financial decisions.
- **Exec perspective**: Options for **public vs private deployments**, governance guardrails with AWS Bedrock, IAM, and SCP.



### Key takeaway

MCP agents enable **faster, more accurate forecasting and cost simulation**, empowering both executives and practitioners to build and validate business cases with confidence.

## CloudFormation Template:

## Prompts:

### First prompt for the set-up:

```
Youâ€™re a Cloud FinOps assistant, knowledgeable about cloud financial management for AWS, Azure, GCP, and you leverage MCP servers to perform your work. You break down business requirements into actionable subtasks. Given business requirements, and taking into consideration architecture guidelines and budget constraints, you output the specified deliverables under the specified format, and summarise your findings, avoiding fluff, background or personal commentary.

Business Requirements:

Prototype for an IoT environmental monitoring system.
50 environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality).
Sensors transmit data every 5 minutes (~14,400 data points/day).
Real-time dashboard for current readings (single-user access).
Historical data visualization and simple trend reporting.
No real-time processing, no alerting, no notifications.
Data retention period: 30 days (demo purposes only).
Region: US East (N. Virginia) â€“ us-east-1 .
24-hour test window for cost validation.


Architecture Guidelines:

EC2 instance (t3.micro) running a simple web application using Node.js or Python (Flask).
RDS instance (db.t3.micro) using MySQL or PostgreSQL for sensor data storage.
S3 bucket for static assets or backup storage.
CloudWatch enabled only for basic monitoring (CPU and status checks).


Budget Constraints:

Target monthly budget: $30 USD.
Target daily budget (for validation/demo): $1.00 USD.
Cost estimation should exclude AWS Free Tier usage.


Deliverables:

Convert estimation to HTML format with DAILY cost breakdown.
Include cost optimization recommendations (Reserved Instances, Spot, right-sizing).
Include an architecture brief and architecture diagram.

CloudFormation template to provision:

EC2 instance.
RDS instance.
S3 bucket.

```



### Second prompt: reality check

```
Can you check the AWS costs from the last 7 days, filtered by the tag aws:cloudformation:stack-name=MCPIoTDemo, and compare them against the cost estimation you previously provided.
```



### Third Prompt: Scaling the prototype and building the business case

```
Now that we have validated our prototype, we want to scale it from 50 to 10,000 sensors.
Indicate which components would require scaling and how that would impact overall cost.
Based on the scaled up architecture, perform a unit economics analysis to determine:
The cost per sensor and the variation from before it scaled

Deliverables:
Estimate cost per sensor per month with the new setup.
Provide recommendations to optimize cost at scale (e.g. instance size upgrades, storage strategies).
Provide a pricing strategy per sensor considering 30% gross margin and summarize it in a business case.
Output in HTML format, include an executive summary for business stakeholders.
```
