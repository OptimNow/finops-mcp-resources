# Vantage MCP Server: AI-Powered Multi-Cloud Cost Analysis 📊🤖

**Sources**: 
- [Vantage MCP Documentation](https://docs.vantage.sh/vantage_mcp#mcp-clients)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vantage-sh/vantage-mcp-server)  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

## What is Vantage MCP? 💡

**Natural language interface to your multi-cloud cost data via AI assistants.**

Instead of logging into multiple dashboards:
```
❌ Before: "Let me check AWS console, then Azure portal, then GCP console..."
✅ After:  "How much did we spend on S3 in us-east-1 last month?"
```

**Key advantage**: Unified cost analysis across **AWS, Azure, GCP, and 15+ other providers** through one AI interface.

## Two Deployment Options 🚀

### **Remote MCP (Recommended)**
- ✅ **Vantage-managed** - No deployment needed
- ✅ **OAuth authentication** - Secure browser-based login
- ✅ **Auto-updates** - Always latest features
- ❌ **Requires Vantage account** for all users

### **Self-Hosted MCP**
- ✅ **Full control** - Deploy in your environment
- ✅ **API key auth** - No browser required
- ✅ **Custom configurations** - Modify as needed
- ❌ **Manual updates** - You manage maintenance

## Quick Implementation 📋

### **Option A: Remote MCP (5 minutes)**

#### **1. Setup Claude Desktop**
```json
// ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vantage MCP Server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.vantage.sh/sse"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Authenticate**
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Browser window opens automatically
- Login to Vantage console
- Done! Start asking cost questions

### **Option B: Self-Hosted MCP**

#### **1. Prerequisites**
```bash
# Create Vantage read-only API token
# Visit: https://console.vantage.sh/settings/api-access-tokens

# Install binary
brew install vantage-sh/tap/vantage-mcp-server
```

#### **2. Configure Claude Desktop**
```json
// claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vantage": {
      "command": "/path/to/vantage-mcp-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "VANTAGE_BEARER_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-World Usage Examples 💰

### **Multi-Cloud Cost Analysis**
```
"What are the top 5 most expensive services this month across AWS, Azure, and GCP?"
"Compare our cloud spend between Q3 and Q4 2024"
"Which provider has the highest data transfer costs?"
```

### **Cost Optimization**
```
"Show me untagged resources costing over $1000/month"
"Which AWS accounts had the biggest spend increase?"
"Are there any cost anomalies in our Kubernetes clusters?"
```

### **Budget Management**
```
"Which teams are over budget this month?"
"What's our forecasted cloud spend for Q1?"
"Show me budget vs actual spend by department"
```

### **Operational Intelligence**
```
"Break down Azure costs by the owner tag for the past 90 days"
"If we deprecate the ap-northeast-2 region, how much could we save?"
"Which services spiked in cost over the last 7 days?"
```

## Best Practices 🎯

### **Effective Prompting**
✅ **Be specific**: "GCP BigQuery spend for September 2024" not "our database costs"  
✅ **Add context**: Include workspace, timeframe, provider, tags  
✅ **Group data**: "Group by month" vs "group by day" for better performance  
✅ **One question at a time**: Avoid stacking unrelated queries  

### **Rate Limits to Know**
- **1,000 requests/hour** account-wide
- **5 requests/5 seconds** for cost reports
- Consider AI client token limits
