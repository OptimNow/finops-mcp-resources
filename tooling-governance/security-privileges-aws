üìù Notes

Billing & Cost Management MCP: this policy uses read APIs (Cost Explorer, CUR, etc.) rather than console-only aws-portal:* actions, which are less portable and only work for IAM users in the payer account.

CFM Tips MCP: requires additional service Describe* calls (EC2, RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.) to fetch optimization data.

CUR files: CFM Tips lists s3:List* permissions. If your runbooks actually read CUR objects, add:üìù Notes

Billing & Cost Management MCP: this policy uses read APIs (Cost Explorer, CUR, etc.) rather than console-only aws-portal:* actions, which are less portable and only work for IAM users in the payer account.

CFM Tips MCP: requires additional service Describe* calls (EC2, RDS, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.) to fetch optimization data.

CUR files: CFM Tips lists s3:List* permissions. If your runbooks actually read CUR objects, add:

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [ "s3:GetObject" ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-cur-bucket>/*"
}

For multi-account setups, prefer assuming a read-only IAM role in each linked account rather than widening permissions in a single account.

üöÄ How to use

Go to IAM Console ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Create policy.

Choose JSON, paste the policy above.

Name it AWS-MCP-ReadOnly and save.

Attach the policy to a dedicated IAM user or role used by your MCP client (e.g. for AWS_PROFILE in your mcp.json).

If you use Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) stored in S3, don‚Äôt forget to extend the policy with s3:GetObject on the CUR bucket.

üëâ This file is now fully self-contained: it has the merged JSON policy, the notes, and clear usage instructions.  

Do you also want me to prepare a **stricter variant** (scoping `Resource` to specific ARNs like `arn:aws:cloudwatch:region:account:alarm/*` or your CUR bucket ARN), or do you prefer to keep it broad (`Resource: "*"`) for now?
