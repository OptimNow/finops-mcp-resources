# FinOps Multi-Agent Demo (Amazon Bedrock)

- A Bedrock **Agents-only** sample (no MCP): a Nova supervisor orchestrates two sub-agents for cost analysis & optimization, surfaced via a simple Amplify web UI.
- Slightly **outdated**, but still a clean look at **multi-agent collaboration** patterns (delegation, tool use, hand-offs) for FinOps workflows.
- Great for learning the architecture; for production, update models/guardrails/IAM and replace workshop defaults.
