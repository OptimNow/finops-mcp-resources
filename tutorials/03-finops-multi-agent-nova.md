# FinOps Multi-Agent with Amazon Nova

**Tutorial 3 of 7** | ⏱️ **Time**: 45-60 minutes | 💻 **Level**: Advanced

**Last Updated**: January 2026

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Build multi-agent FinOps systems using Amazon Bedrock
- Implement agent orchestration patterns with Amazon Nova as supervisor
- Design delegation workflows between cost analysis and optimization agents
- Deploy agentic FinOps solutions with AWS Amplify web UI
- Apply advanced multi-agent collaboration patterns for cloud cost management

---

## Overview

A Bedrock **Agents-only** sample (no MCP): a Nova supervisor orchestrates two sub-agents for cost analysis & optimization, surfaced via a simple Amplify web UI.

**Status**: Slightly **outdated**, but still a clean look at **multi-agent collaboration** patterns (delegation, tool use, hand-offs) for FinOps workflows. Great for learning the architecture; for production, update models/guardrails/IAM and replace workshop defaults.
