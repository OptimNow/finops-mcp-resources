# MCP Clients Comparison

## Why do we need a client?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers expose capabilities — like querying AWS pricing data, running tagging checks, or doing cost simulations — but they cannot be used directly.  
They need a **client** (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Amazon Q, etc.) that acts as the interface between:
- **You / the LLM** (where you type prompts)  
- **MCP servers** (tools that provide data or actions)  

The client is responsible for:
- **Launching and managing servers** (based on `mcp.json` configs)  
- **Routing requests** from the LLM to the right MCP server  
- **Handling security** (auth, permissions, logs)  
- **Presenting results** in a human-friendly way (tables, charts, code blocks)  

👉 Without a client, the MCP servers are just “idle executables.” The client is the **orchestrator** that makes them useful.

## Clients Compared
For Cloud FinOps professionals, especially in multi-cloud or enterprise settings:
- **VS Code + Github CoPilot** – Best primary cockpit: all-in-one environment, extensible, familiar for engineers, integrates MCPs cleanly.
- **Claude** – Excellent companion for demos, quick explorations, and making FinOps data accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Amazon Q** – Great for AWS-native teams; handy in-console assistant, but limited to single-cloud and adds lock-in.
- **Cursor** – Interesting for experimentation, but feels too dev-oriented and immature for FinOps production needs.

## Recommendations & Final Take
👉 Final take: Use VS Code + Gihub CoPilot as your daily FinOps + MCP cockpit, complement with Claude for business-facing queries and demos, and keep Q/Cursor in the toolbox for specific contexts.
