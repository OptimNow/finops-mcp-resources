Cursor is an AI-powered IDE that integrates MCP servers directly into your development environment, letting you call APIs, automate tasks, and test agents without leaving your coding/editor workflow.

‚úÖ **Pros for a Cloud FinOps professional**
- Direct MCP integration: you can query cost APIs, run pricing simulations, or test optimization agents straight from the IDE.
- Productivity boost: less context-switching between CLI, browser, and dashboards.
- Experimentation space: quick way to validate FinOps automation ideas before pushing them into production.
- Collaboration: code, prompts, and MCP configs live in one place‚Äîeasier to share with teammates.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons for a Cloud FinOps professional**
- Developer-oriented: feels more natural for engineers than for FinOps analysts focused on reporting and governance.
- Steep setup curve: you need to configure MCP endpoints, tokens, and environments‚Äîmight feel ‚Äútooling heavy.‚Äù
- Risk of distraction: its AI-assistant features may nudge you into coding/prototyping instead of focusing on cost governance.
- Not enterprise-ready alone: lacks the guardrails (access control, audit logs) you‚Äôd need in a regulated FinOps context.

üëâ **In short**: Cursor + MCP is great for rapid FinOps prototyping and automation, but for day-to-day enterprise FinOps you‚Äôll still need more structured, governed platforms.
