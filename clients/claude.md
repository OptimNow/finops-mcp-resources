Claude is Anthropic‚Äôs AI assistant that can connect to MCP servers, letting you query data, run analyses, and automate workflows in natural language instead of writing code.

‚úÖ Pros for a Cloud FinOps professional
- Natural language interface: ask for cost breakdowns, RI/SP coverage, or forecast simulations without coding.
- MCP-native: plugs directly into AWS, Azure, or custom MCP servers (pricing, cost explorer, tagging compliance, etc.).
- Fast prototyping: ideal for demos and ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios to validate FinOps ideas on the fly.
- Accessible to non-devs: finance or ops stakeholders can use it without technical expertise.

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons for a Cloud FinOps professional
- Pro subscription needed: to access Claude Sonnet 4 (the model that handles MCPs well) you need a paid tier.
- Token limits: even with Pro, large reports or multi-server queries can hit token ceilings.
- Reliability risk: outputs depend on MCP data quality and prompt design.
- Not a governance layer: lacks audit trails, approvals, and enterprise guardrails.
- Vendor lock-in: tied to Anthropic‚Äôs ecosystem and roadmap.
- Temptation to over-trust: answers feel authoritative, but need human validation before implementation.

üëâ In short: Claude + MCP makes FinOps exploration conversational and fast, but between subscription costs, token limits, and missing enterprise guardrails, it‚Äôs more demo/prototyping tool than production-ready solution.
