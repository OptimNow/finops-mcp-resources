# Which MCP Client Should I Use for FinOps? — Comparison Guide

**Last Updated**: March 2026

A side-by-side comparison of all major MCP clients for cloud cost optimization, FinOps automation, and AI-powered cost management. Covers Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, and more.

## Why do I need an MCP client?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers expose powerful capabilities — like querying AWS pricing data, running tagging checks, or doing cost simulations — but they cannot be used directly. They need a **client** (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Kiro CLI, etc.) that acts as the interface between you (where you type prompts) and the MCP servers (tools that provide data or actions).

The client serves as the orchestrator of the entire MCP ecosystem. It launches and manages servers based on `mcp.json` configurations, routes your requests from the LLM to the appropriate MCP server, handles security concerns like authentication and permissions, and presents results in human-friendly formats such as tables, charts, and code blocks. Without a client, MCP servers are just "idle executables" — the client is what transforms them into useful, accessible tools that augment your AI assistant's capabilities.

## Clients Compared

**Last Updated: March 2026**

As of March 2026, MCP is supported by all major AI platforms. Here's how they compare for Cloud FinOps professionals:

### **For Technical FinOps Teams (DevOps/Platform Engineering)**
- **Claude Code** – Best for infrastructure-as-code workflows, with remote MCP support, task workflows, and enterprise controls. Requires developer skills.
- **Kiro** – Agentic IDE with native MCP, spec-driven development, and agent hooks. Ideal for AWS-focused teams integrating FinOps into IaC workflows. Still in public preview.
- **VS Code + Extensions (Cline)** – Flexible, extensible, familiar for engineers. Supports multiple MCP-enabled extensions.
- **Cursor** – Developer-focused IDE with MCP support. Good for experimentation but less mature for production FinOps.

### **For Business/Finance Stakeholders**
- **Claude Desktop** – Best-in-class for MCP-powered FinOps analysis. Native MCP support from Anthropic, excellent for demos, explorations, and making complex cost data accessible through natural language.
- **ChatGPT** – Most accessible to non-technical users. Massive user base, conversational interface, good for quick analyses. MCP support arrived March 2025.
- **Microsoft Copilot** – Best for Microsoft 365 organizations; share insights via Teams, Excel, PowerPoint. Requires Copilot Studio for full MCP.
- **Google Gemini** – Ideal for GCP-centric teams using BigQuery billing exports. Strong multi-modal capabilities.

### **For Cloud-Specific Use Cases**
- **Kiro CLI (formerly Amazon Q)** – Great for AWS-native teams; command-line interface perfect for scripting and automation, but limited to AWS and adds vendor lock-in.
- **Kiro** – Strong AWS integration (backed by AWS), ideal for AWS-centric DevOps teams managing infrastructure as code.
- **Microsoft Copilot** – Best for Azure-first organizations with existing Microsoft 365 investments.
- **Google Gemini** – Best for GCP-centric FinOps teams wanting to keep data in Google Cloud.

### **Quick Comparison Table**

| Client | Best For | MCP Support | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Claude Code** | DevOps/IaC teams | Native, remote servers | Developer-first, task workflows, enterprise controls | Requires technical skills |
| **Kiro** | AWS DevOps/IaC teams | Native, remote servers | Spec-driven, agent hooks, AWS integration, free preview | Early stage, AWS bias, technical barrier |
| **ChatGPT** | Business users | Native (March 2025) | Accessible, huge user base, API access | Data privacy concerns, subscription costs |
| **Claude Desktop** | Demos & exploration | Native | Fast prototyping, conversational | Token limits, Pro subscription |
| **Gemini** | GCP teams | Native (April 2025) | GCP integration, Vertex AI | GCP bias, API-focused |
| **Copilot** | Microsoft 365 orgs | GA in Copilot Studio | Azure/M365 integration, governance | Complex licensing, setup overhead |
| **VS Code** | Engineers | Via extensions | Extensible, familiar | Requires configuration |
| **Kiro CLI** | AWS CLI users | Native | AWS integration, scriptable | AWS-only, vendor lock-in |
| **Cursor** | Developers | Native | Modern IDE features | Less mature for FinOps |

## Recommendations & Final Take

**March 2026 Recommendations:**

For **multi-cloud FinOps teams**:
1. **Primary cockpit**: Claude Code or VS Code for technical work (IaC, CI/CD, cost optimization)
2. **Business layer**: ChatGPT or Claude Desktop for executive reports, demos, stakeholder communication
3. **Cloud-specific**: Use Kiro CLI (AWS), Copilot (Azure), or Gemini (GCP) when deep cloud-native integration is needed

For **cloud-specific teams**:
- **AWS-first**: Kiro (for DevOps/IaC) or Kiro CLI (for command-line/scripting) + Claude Code
- **Azure-first**: Microsoft Copilot + Claude Code
- **GCP-first**: Google Gemini + Claude Code

For **teams exploring agentic workflows**:
- **Kiro** – If you want spec-driven development, agent hooks, and AWS integration (preview stage)
- **Claude Code** – If you need production-ready stability with remote MCP support

For **non-technical FinOps practitioners**:
- Start with **ChatGPT** (easiest, most accessible) or **Claude Desktop** (best MCP support)
- Add cloud-specific tools (Kiro CLI/Copilot/Gemini) based on primary cloud provider

👉 **Bottom line** (March 2026): MCP has matured from a niche protocol to industry-standard infrastructure. Choose clients based on your team's technical skills, cloud environment, and whether you need developer tools or business-friendly interfaces.
