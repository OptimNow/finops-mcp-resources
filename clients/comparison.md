Recommendation: for Cloud FinOps professionals, especially in multi-cloud or enterprise settings:
- VS Code â€“ Best primary cockpit: all-in-one environment, extensible, familiar for engineers, integrates MCPs cleanly.
- Claude â€“ Excellent companion for demos, quick explorations, and making FinOps data accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- Amazon Q â€“ Great for AWS-native teams; handy in-console assistant, but limited to single-cloud and adds lock-in.
- Cursor â€“ Interesting for experimentation, but feels too dev-oriented and immature for FinOps production needs.

ðŸ‘‰ Final take: Use VS Code as your daily FinOps + MCP cockpit, complement with Claude for business-facing queries and demos, and keep Q/Cursor in the toolbox for specific contexts.
