Installing Amazon Q: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-installing.html

Amazon Q is AWS‚Äôs generative AI assistant that integrates with MCP servers in the background, letting you query AWS data, get recommendations, and automate tasks directly in the AWS Console, IDEs, or chat.

‚úÖ Pros for a Cloud FinOps professional
- Native to AWS: works inside the AWS Console, so you can ask for budget variance, cost breakdowns, or optimization ideas without leaving the portal.
- Integrated workflows: hooks into Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and other AWS services through MCP connectors.
- Context-rich answers: leverages AWS identity, org structure, and cloud data‚Äîno need to reconfigure credentials.
- Pro productivity: great for quick ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù checks during budget reviews or optimization sessions.
- Collaboration: usable in IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains) as well as QuickSight for reporting.

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons for a Cloud FinOps professional
- AWS-only: no cross-cloud MCP integration, making it partial for multi-cloud FinOps.
- Subscription required: advanced features come with extra AWS costs, not bundled free.
- Opaque recommendations: hard to validate what data or logic Q is using behind the scenes.
- Enterprise gaps: still maturing in governance and security.
- Lock-in risk: ties your FinOps practice tightly to AWS, reducing portability.

üëâ In short: Amazon Q is a natural MCP client for AWS-native FinOps, powerful for speed and convenience‚Äîbut limited for multi-cloud and lacking full governance/audit depth.
