VS Code is a lightweight but powerful code editor that integrates MCP servers through extensions, giving you a one-stop environment with files, terminal, and LLM prompting all in one place.

‚úÖ Pros for a Cloud FinOps professional
- One environment: code, command terminal, MCP configs, and even LLM prompts live side by side.
- Easy installs: many GitHub repos include a one-click ‚ÄúInstall in VS Code‚Äù button, reducing setup friction.
- Huge extension ecosystem: FinOps scripts, cost dashboards, and automation tools are easier to manage.
- Customizable workflows: tailor the environment for reporting, optimization scripts, or MCP testing.
- Familiarity: widely used by devs and ops teams, lowering adoption barriers across orgs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons for a Cloud FinOps professional
- Dev-oriented bias: heavy IDE, may feel overkill if your FinOps tasks are more reporting/analysis than coding.
- Setup complexity: MCP servers still require config, credentials, and ongoing maintenance.
- Distraction risk: with terminal, code, and AI prompts all in one place, easy to get lost tinkering.
- Not a governance solution: same as Cursor/Claude, lacks guardrails, audit logs, and enterprise-grade access controls.
- Resource usage: can be heavier than simpler FinOps dashboards or CLI tools.

üëâ In short: VS Code + MCP gives you an integrated, friction-free dev/FinOps cockpit, but its dev-centric nature and lack of governance make it more of a prototyping and engineering tool than a polished FinOps platform.
