# Kiro CLI (formerly Amazon Q)

**Installing Kiro CLI**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-installing.html

**Kiro CLI** is the evolution of Amazon Q, AWS's generative AI assistant for the command line. In late 2024, AWS rebranded and expanded Amazon Q's command-line capabilities as **Kiro CLI**, providing a more powerful terminal-native experience for developers and cloud professionals.

Kiro CLI integrates with MCP servers in the background, letting you query AWS data, get recommendations, and automate tasks directly from your terminal. While Amazon Q continues to exist as the web/IDE assistant, **Kiro CLI is the recommended tool for command-line MCP interactions**.

✅ **Pros for a Cloud FinOps professional**
- **Terminal-native**: Works directly in your command line, perfect for scripting and automation workflows
- **Native to AWS**: Seamlessly integrates with Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and other AWS services through MCP connectors
- **Context-rich answers**: Leverages AWS identity, org structure, and cloud data—no need to reconfigure credentials
- **Pro productivity**: Great for quick "what if" checks during budget reviews or optimization sessions
- **Scriptable**: Command-line interface makes it easy to integrate into FinOps automation pipelines

⚠️ **Cons for a Cloud FinOps professional**
- **AWS-only**: No cross-cloud MCP integration, making it limited for multi-cloud FinOps
- **Subscription required**: Advanced features come with extra AWS costs, not bundled free
- **Opaque recommendations**: Hard to validate what data or logic Kiro CLI is using behind the scenes
- **Enterprise gaps**: Still maturing in governance and security features
- **Lock-in risk**: Ties your FinOps practice tightly to AWS, reducing portability

👉 **In short**: Kiro CLI (formerly Amazon Q) is a natural MCP client for AWS-native FinOps, powerful for speed and command-line convenience—but limited for multi-cloud environments and lacking full governance/audit depth.
